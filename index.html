    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[First of all, et a <strong>SSL certificate</strong> This will allow your site to send sensitive information all through Internet encrypted. This way only the destined recipients will receive it. Besides, having a SSL certificate will give your website authentication, which means it’ll be sending the info to the right server and not an impostor.
       <strong>Keep updates up to date</strong> Avoiding software updates could bring heavy consequences for your website as attackers are quick in finding holes which to get in through and gain control inside. This is exactly why it’s important for you to keep your website’s platform and software updated, specially if you’re using a CMS like WordPress, with a lot of plugins, to manage the content.]</p>
